i  had  to  say  something  .  i  had  to  say  something  .  everything  was  going  so  well;  i  had  to  say  something  .
i  told  her  i  liked  her  .  why  ?  why  did  i  tell  her  i  like  her  ?  i  have  this  sick  compulsion  to  tell  women  how  i  feel  .  i  like  you  i  don't  tell  you  .
i'm  outta  the  picture  .  i  am  outta  the  picture  .  STAGEDIR  it's  only  a  matter  of  time  now  .
oh  no  .  no  ,  no  ,  no  ,  no  .
i'll  tell  you  when  it  happened  .  when  that  floss  came  flying  out  of  my  pocket  .
we  were  in  the  lobby  during  the  intermission  of  the  play  .  i  was  buying  her  one  of  those  containers  of  orange  drink  ,  for  five  dollars  .  i  reached  into  my  pocket  to  pay  for  it  ,  i  looked  down;  there's  this  piece  of  green  floss  hanging  from  my  fingers  .
of  course  .  so  ,  i'm  looking  at  it  ,  i  look  up  ,  i  see  she's  looking  at  it  .  our  eyes  lock  .  it  was  a  horrible  moment  .  i  just  .  .
if  i  didn't  put  that  floss  in  my  pocket  ,  i'd  be  crawling  around  her  bedroom  right  now  looking  for  my  glasses  .
yes  ,  i  am  .
what  ?  you  don't  like  this  ?
what  do  you  mean  wednesday  ?  i  though  we  had  tickets  to  the  knick  game  wednesday  .  we  got  seats  behind  the  bench  !  what  happened  ?  we're  not  going  ?
oh  .  who  is  this  guy  ?
i  don't  know  why  you  even  bother  with  this  ping  pong  guy  ,  i'll  tell  you  that  .
i  don't  understand  why  you  spend  time  with  this  guy  .
no  ,  no  ,  no  ,  no  you  have  to  approach  this  as  if  he  was  a  woman  .
absolutely  .  you  just  tell  him  the  truth  .
.  .  she  calls  me  up  at  my  office  ,  she  says  ,  "  we  have  to  talk  .  "
that  ,  or  "  who's  bra  is  this  ?  "
so  we  order  lunch  ,  and  we're  talking  .  finally  ,  she  blurts  out  how  it's  "  not  working  "  .
so  ,  i'm  thinking  ,  as  she's  saying  this  ,  i'm  thinking
we  sat  there  for  twenty  minutes  ,  chewing  ,  staring  at  each  other  in  a  defunct  relationship  .
have  you  ever  had  their  egg  salad  ?
it's  unbelievable  .  you  know  what  else  is  unbelievable  ?  i  picked  up  the  check  .  she  didn't  even  offer  .  she  ended  it  .  the  least  she  could  do  is  send  me  off  with  a  sandwich  .
STAGEDIR  that's  funny  .  you're  a  funny  guy  .
ewing's  hurt  ?  how  long  is  he  going  to  be  out  ?

STAGEDIR  well  ,  you've  scared  her  off  .  we  may  never  see  mom  again  .
dad  .  we  need  to  talk  .
STAGEDIR  not  necessarily  .  why  don't  you  take  back  the  couch  you  gave  me  ?

she  can't  kill  me  right  ?  !
people  break  up  all  the  time  .
it  just  didn't  work  out  .  what  can  i  do  ?  i  wanted  to  love  her  .  i  tried  to  love  her  .  i  couldn't  .
i  kept  looking  at  her  face  .  i'd  go
oh  ,  i  had  no  choice  .  she  squeezed  it  out  of  me  !  she'd  tell  me  she  loved  me  .  alright  ,  at  first  ,  i  just  look  at  her  .  i'd  go  "  oh  ,  really  ?  "  or  "  boy  ,  that's  ,  that's  something  .  "  but  ,  eventually  you  have  to  come  back  with  "  well  ,  i  love  you  .  "  you  know  ,  you  can  only  hold  out  for  so  long  !  "
and  i  didn't  even  ask  her  out  .  she  asked  me  out  first  .  she  called  me  up  .  what  was  i  supposed  to  do  ?  say  no  ?  i  can't  do  that  to  someone  .
i  am  .  i'm  a  nice  guy  .  .  STAGEDIR  and  she  seduced  me  !  we  were  in  my  apartment  ,  i'm  sitting  on  the  couch  ,  she's  on  the  chair  -  i  get  up  to  go  to  the  bathroom  ,  i  come  back  ,  she's  on  the  couch  .  what  am  i  supposed  to  do  ?  not  do  anything  ?  i  couldn't  do  that  .  i  would've  insulted  her  .
i  had  nothing  to  do  wtih  any  of  this  !  i  met  all  her  friends  ,  i  didn't  want  to  meet  them  .  i  kept  trying  to  avoid  it  .  i  knew  it  would  only  get  me  in  deeper  .  but  they  were  everywhere  !  they  kept  popping  up  ,  all  over  the  place  .  "  this  is  nancy  ,  this  is  susan  ,  this  is  amy  .  .  this  is  my  cousin  .  .  this  is  my  brother  .  .  thisis  my  father  .  "  it's  like  i'm  in  quicksand  .
my  back  is  killing  me  .
oh  yeah  ,  everybody's  guy  is  the  best  .
please  .  they  don't  do  anything  .  .  look  ,  do  i  have  to  break  up  with  her  in  person  ?  can't  i  do  it  over  the  phone  ?  i  have  no  stomach  for  these  things  .
i'm  letting  you  in  .
no  ,  you  won't  .
okay  .  .
please  ,  it  doesn't  look  good  .  boy  ,  boy  ,  girl  .
is  it  that  obvious  ?
STAGEDIR  "  you  know  ,  i'd  go  from  nods  to  nothing  .  .  "
i  think  you  absolutely  have  to  say  something  to  this  guy  .  confront  him  .
yes  .
if  i  was  a  different  person  .
i'm  outta  there  .  i  did  it  !  it's  over  .
i  told  her  .  in  the  kitchen  -  which  was  risky  'cause  it's  near  all  the  knives  .  i  started  with  the  word  "  listen  .  "
i  said  ,  "  listen  marlene  ,  "  and  then  the  next  thing  i  know  ,  i'm  in  the  middle  of  it  .  and  there's  this  voice  inside  of  me  going
no  ,  i  ,  i  don't  think  so  .
oh  no  ,  thank  you  .
no  ,  really  .  no  ,  no  ,  thanks  .
except  for  one  small  problem  .  i  left  some  books  in  her  apartment  .
oh  ,  no  .  no  ,  i  can't  go  back  there  .  jerry  ,  it's  so  awkward  and  ,  you  know  ,  it  could  be  dangerous  -  sexually  .  something  could  happen  ,  i'd  be  right  back  where  i  started  .
well  ,  yeah  .
i  don't  know  .  they're  books  .
they're  my  books  .
jerry  ,  it's  not  my  fault  .
that's  standard  .  has  she  left  you  one  of  those  messages  where  she  uses  up  the  whole  machine  ?
what  about  getting  off  the  phone  ?
just  do  it  like  a  band-aid  .  one  motion  ,  right  off  !  she  is  sexy  though  .  don't  you  think  ?
yeah  .
STAGEDIR  yeah  ,  doctor  .  i'm  going  to  have  to  wait  in  that  little  room  by  myself  ,  aren't  i  ?  STAGEDIR  i  better  take  this  .  i  hate  the  little  room  .  "  oh  ,  hello  ,  doctor  .  "
i  was  in  there  for  two  minutes  .  he  didn't  do  anything  .  STAGEDIR  touch  this  ,  feel  that  .  seventy-five  bucks  .

i  was  trying  to  make  a  point  .
STAGEDIR  i  think  i  swallowed  a  fly  !  .  .  i  swallowed  a  fly  !  what  do  i  do  ?  what  can  happen  ?
"  master  of  the  house  .  .  doling  out  the  charm  ,  ready  with  a  handshake  and  an  open  palm  .  tells  a  saucy  talke  ,  loves  to  make  a  stir  everyone  appreciates  a  .  .  "

yeah  ,  he'll  be  looking  at  us  like  he's  backstage  at  a  puppet  show  .
"  master  of  the  house  ,  keeper  of  the  inn  .  .  "  STAGEDIR  this  is  huge  !  when  did  this  happen  ?
STAGEDIR  can  i  say  one  thing  to  you  ?  and  i  say  this  wiht  an  unblemished  record  of  staunch  heterosexuality  .
.  .  it's  fabulous  .
and  i'll  tell  you  something  else  ,  i'm  not  even  going  to  ask  you  .  i  want  to  know  .  but  i'm  not  going  to  ask  .  you'll  tell  me  when  you  feel  comfortable  .  .  so  what  was  it  ?  four  hundred  ?  five  hundred  ?  did  you  pay  five  hundred  for  this  ?  STAGEDIR  over  six  ?  can't  be  seven  .  don't  tell  my  you  paid  seven  hundred  dollars  for  this  jacket  !  did  you  pay  seven  hundred  dollars  for  this  jacket  ?  is  that  what  you're  saying  to  me  ?  !  you  are  sick  !  is  that  what  you  paid  for  this  jacket  ?  !  over  seven  hundred  ?  what  did  you  pay  for  this  jacket  ?  i  won't  say  anything  .  i  wanna  know  what  you  paid  for  this  jacket  !  oh  my  god  !  a  thousand  dollars  ?  !  you  paid  a  thousand  dollars  for  this  jacket  ?  !  alright  ,  fine  .  i'm  walking  out  of  here  right  now  thinking  you  paid  a  thousand  dollars  for  this  jacket  ,  unless  you  tell  me  different  .  STAGEDIR  oh  ,  ho  !  alright  !  i'll  tell  you  what  ,  if  you  don't  say  anything  in  the  next  five  seconds  ,  i'll  know  it  was  over  a  thousand  .  .
well  ,  i'm  going  with  him  .  i'd  like  to  ,  i've  never  done  a  solid  before  .
"  master  of  the  house  .  quick  to  catch  your  eye  ,  never  wants  a  passerby  to  pass  him  by  .  "
maybe  he  didn't  show  up  .
i  don't  think  there's  ever  been  an  appointment  in  my  life  where  i  wanted  the  other  guy  to  show  up  .
STAGEDIR  wait  a  second  ,  is  that  him  ?
i'm  nervous  .
STAGEDIR  it's  a  great  thrill  to  meet  you  ,  sir  .
and  ,  i'll  have  a  club  soda  with  no  ice  .
you  like  ice  ?
i  said  ,  do  you  like  ice  ?
don't  you  think  you  get  more  without  it  ?
yeah  ,  yeah  .  she's  punctual  .  .  and  she's  been  late  sometimes  .
i  guess  today  she's  late  .
yep  .
STAGEDIR  i  know  ,  i  know  ,  that's  what  they  said  .
the  weather  guy  ,  dr  .  waldo  .
no  ,  of  course  not  .  i  didn't  .  .
STAGEDIR  oh  ,  he's  the  comedian  .
no  ,  no  .  he's  just  being  modest  .
i  just  wanted  to  tell  you  that  i  really  enjoyed  fair  game  .  i  thought  it  was  just  brilliant  .
maybe  some  parts  .
the  drivel  parts  .  .  oh  my  gosh  ,  i  just  realized  -  i  have  to  make  a  phone  call  .  i  can  believe  .  .  would  you  .  .  STAGEDIR
thank  you  for  leaving  me  alone  with  him  !
well  ,  let's  just  leave  .
where  is  she  ?
how  could  she  leave  us  alone  with  this  lunatic  ?  ten  more  minutes  ,  and  that's  it  !  i'm  leaving  .  i  have  to  tell  you  ,  this  guy  scares  me  .
if  she  doesn't  show  up  ,  we  can't  possibly  have  dinner  with  him  alone  .
we'll  say  we're  frightened  and  we  have  to  go  home  .
i  don't  know  .  just  start  scratching  .  tell  him  you  have  the  crabs  .  he  was  in  the  military  .  he'll  understand  that  .
STAGEDIR  my  uncle  is  having  an  operation  .  i  just  wanted  to  see  how  he  was  .
bone  marrow  .
sure  ,  guatemala  .
come  on  ,  let's  go  !
to  hell  with  elaine  !
we're  dying  here  !
STAGEDIR  he's  in  the  bathroom  .
couldn't  be  better  .
get  outta  here  .  .
where  do  you  come  up  with  this  stuff  ?
"  master  of  the  house  ,  doling  out  the  charm  .  ready  with  a  handshake  and  an  open  .  .  "
i  wouldn't  think  so  .
STAGEDIR  why  don't  you  just  turn  it  inside  out  ?
it's  only  a  few  blocks  .
you  know  ,  i've  been  thinking  .  .  i  cannot  envision  any  circumstances  in  which  i'll  ever  have  the  opportunity  to  have  sex  again  .  how's  it  gonna  happen  ?  i  just  don't  see  how  it  could  occur  .
they  always  make  me  take  stock  of  my  life  and  how  i've  pretty  much  wasted  all  of  it  ,  and  how  i  plan  to  continue  wasting  it  .
you  know  ,  i  can't  believe  you're  even  considering  not  playing  .  we  need  you  .  you're  hitting  everything  .
STAGEDIR  who's  going  to  play  left  field  ?
bender  ?  he  can't  play  left  .  he  stinks  .  i  just  don't  see  what  purpose  is  it  going  to  serve  your  going  ?  i  mean  ,  you  think  dead  peole  care  who's  at  the  funeral  ?  they  don't  even  know  they're  having  a  funeral  .  it's  not  like  she's  hanging  out  in  the  back  going  ,  "  i  can't  believe  jerry  didn't  show  up  .  "
if  you're  a  spirit  ,  and  you  can  travel  to  other  dimensions  and  galaxies  ,  and  find  out  the  mysteries  of  the  universe  ,  you  think  she's  going  to  want  to  hang  around  drexler's  funeral  home  on  ocean  parkway  ?
you  know  how  easy  it  is  for  dead  people  to  travel  ?  it's  not  like  getting  on  a  bus  .  one  second  .  it's  all  mental  .
who  gets  picked  off  in  softball  ?  it's  unheard  of  .
and  they  in  the  fifth  inning  ,  why  did  you  take  off  on  the  pop  fly  ?
what  about  sharon  besser  ?
maybe  manya  missed  the  funeral  because  she  was  off  visiting  another  galaxy  that  day  .
not  necessarily  .  STAGEDIR
i  never  heard  him  say  anything  really  funny  .
you  would  think  that  ,  but  either  you're  born  with  a  sense  of  humor  ,  or  you're  not  .  it's  not  going  to  change  even  if  you  go  from  the  red  sun  of  krypton  all  the  way  to  the  yellow  sun  of  the  earth  .
i  don't  know  but  he  ain't  funny  .
pardon  ?
guys  with  cats  .  .  i  don't  know  .
oh  no  .  no  ,  no  ,  no  ,  no  ,  no  .  i'd  have  to  advise  against  that  .  what  do  you  know  this  woman  ,  a  month  ?  let's  see  ,  you're  going  to  be  with  her  seventy-two  hours  .  that's  a  dating  decathlon  .
STAGEDIR  that's  exquisite  .  listen  ,  uh  ,  if  it's  not  too  much  trouble  ,  could  you  pass  me  that  paper  over  there  ?
STAGEDIR  up  again  ?  !  this  is  incredible  .  i'm  .  .  i'm  getting  it  .

i  don't  know  .  but  simons  said  that  if  i  wanted  to  get  involved  ,  that  wilkinson  would  tell  me  the  exact  right  minute  to  sell  .  you  wanna  do  it  ?
it's  sendrax  .  they've  got  some  new  kind  of  technique  for  televising  opera  .

STAGEDIR  check  the  raiser  .

all  simons  was  able  to  find  out  is  that  he's  in  the  hospital  .
of  course  he's  been  in  touch  with  him  .  he's  left  two  messages  .  he  just  hasn't  heard  back  yet  ,  that's  all  .
just  give  it  a  little  more  time  .
alright  ,  alright  .  that's  it  .  i'm  gonna  go  down  there  .
to  the  hospital  .
i'm  going  to  find  out  what's  going  on  .  alright  ?
so  what  ?  i'll  start  talking  to  him  ,  you  know  ,  casual  ,  and  i'll  work  my  way  around  to  it  .
maybe  he's  resting  .
what  are  you  ,  a  doctor  ?
today  .  i'm  going  today  .  just  don't  do  anything  until  you  hear  from  me  .
STAGEDIR  boy  ,  i  have  to  get  to  a  bathroom  .
fifteen  seconds  .
yeah  ,  i  mentioned  simons  .  next  thing  i  know  -  i'm  in  the  parking  lot  .  perhaps  they  had  some  sort  of  a  falling  out  .  i'll  tell  you  one  thing  .  .  i  don't  know  what  he's  got  .  but  for  a  sick  guy  ,  he's  very  strong  .
STAGEDIR  not  quite  .
i'm  keeping  it  .  i'm  going  down  with  the  ship  .
have  something  else  .  c'mon  ,  have  a  little  dessert  ?
elaine  ,  get  something  !  it's  all  taken  care  of  .
so  don't  finish  it  .
i  don't  like  to  discuss  figures  .
i  don't  know  ,  what  ?  eight  thousand  .  it's  a  hyundai  .  get  out  of  here  .  .  i  told  you  not  to  sell  .  simons  made  money  ,  wilkinson  cleaned  up  .
no  .  you'd  be  surprised  .  you  don't  recover  that  quickly  from  a  nose  job  .
he  chose  the  cats  ?
i  told  you  those  trips  were  relationship  killers  .  too  bad  you  can't  get  your  buddy  superman  to  fly  around  the  earth  at  super  speed  and  reverse  time  .  you'd  get  all  the  money  back  -  you  could  have  avoided  the  whole  trip  to  vermont  .
wilkinson's  got  a  bite  on  a  new  one  .  .  petramco  corp  .  out  of  ,  uh  ,  springfield  .  i  think  .  they're  about  to  introduce  some  sort  of  robot  butcher  .
