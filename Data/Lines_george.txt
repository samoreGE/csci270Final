(MaleUnbonding) i  had  to  say  something  .  i  had  to  say  something  .  everything  was  going  so  well;  i  had  to  say  something  .
(MaleUnbonding) i  told  her  i  liked  her  .  why  ?  why  did  i  tell  her  i  like  her  ?  i  have  this  sick  compulsion  to  tell  women  how  i  feel  .  i  like  you  i  don't  tell  you  .

(MaleUnbonding) of  course  .  so  ,  i'm  looking  at  it  ,  i  look  up  ,  i  see  she's  looking  at  it  .  our  eyes  lock  .  it  was  a  horrible  moment  .  i  just  .  .
(MaleUnbonding) if  i  didn't  put  that  floss  in  my  pocket  ,  i'd  be  crawling  around  her  bedroom  right  now  looking  for  my  glasses  .

(TheJacket) "  master  of  the  house  ,  doling  out  the  charm  .  ready  with  a  handshake  and  an  open  .  .  "
(TheJacket) i  wouldn't  think  so  .
(TheJacket) STAGEDIR  why  don't  you  just  turn  it  inside  out  ?
(TheJacket) it's  only  a  few  blocks  .

(ThePonyRemark) they  always  make  me  take  stock  of  my  life  and  how  i've  pretty  much  wasted  all  of  it  ,  and  how  i  plan  to  continue  wasting  it  .
(ThePonyRemark) you  know  ,  i  can't  believe  you're  even  considering  not  playing  .  we  need  you  .  you're  hitting  everything  .
(ThePonyRemark) STAGEDIR  who's  going  to  play  left  field  ?
(ThePonyRemark) bender  ?  he  can't  play  left  .  he  stinks  .  i  just  don't  see  what  purpose  is  it  going  to  serve  your  going  ?  i  mean  ,  you  think  dead  peole  care  who's  at  the  funeral  ?  they  don't  even  know  they're  having  a  funeral  .  it's  not  like  she's  hanging  out  in  the  back  going  ,  "  i  can't  believe  jerry  didn't  show  up  .  "
(ThePonyRemark) if  you're  a  spirit  ,  and  you  can  travel  to  other  dimensions  and  galaxies  ,  and  find  out  the  mysteries  of  the  universe  ,  you  think  she's  going  to  want  to  hang  around  drexler's  funeral  home  on  ocean  parkway  ?
