(TheExGirlfriend) yes  ,  i  will  ,  george  .  i'll  have  to  sick  my  chin  on  top  of  the  seat  .
(TheExGirlfriend) why  can't  you  sit  in  the  middle  ?
(TheExGirlfriend) i  think  you're  afraid  to  sit  next  to  a  man  .  you're  a  little  homophobic  ,  aren't  you  ?
(TheExGirlfriend) hello  ,  jerry  .
(TheExGirlfriend) did  you  get  a  haircut  ?
(TheExGirlfriend) tell  me  if  you  think  this  is  strange
(TheExGirlfriend) and  now  ,  there's  this  intense  animosity  whenever  we  passs  .  i  mean  ,  it's  like  we  really  hate  each  other  .  it's  based  on  nothing  .
(TheExGirlfriend) really  ?
(TheExGirlfriend) you  would  do  that  ?
(TheExGirlfriend) hi  .  STAGEDIR
(TheExGirlfriend) you  know  ,  you  have  the  slowest  elevator  in  the  entire  city  ?  that's  hard  to  get  used  to  when  you're  in  so  many  other  fast  ones  .
(TheExGirlfriend) unless  you're  married  to  a  dictator  .  .
(TheExGirlfriend) right  .  exactly  .  so  i  imagine  at  some  point  ,  somebody's  going  to  offer  me  some  cantaloupe  .
(TheExGirlfriend) so  ,  i  had  what  you  might  call  a  little  encounter  this  morning  .
(TheExGirlfriend) yep  .
(TheExGirlfriend) yep  .  i  spotted  him  getting  his  mail  .  and  at  first  ,  i  was  just  going  to  walk  on  by  ,  but  then  i  thought  "  no  ,  no  ,  no  ,  no  .  do  not  be  afraid  of  this  man  .  "
(TheExGirlfriend) so  ,  i  walked  up  behind  him  and  i  tapped  him  on  the  shoulder  .  and  i  said  ,  "  hi  ,  remember  me  ?  "  and  he  furrows  his  brow  as  if  he's  really  trying  to  figure  it  out  .  so  i  said  to  him  ,  i  said  ,  "  you  little  phony  .  you  know  exactly  who  i  am  .  "
(TheExGirlfriend) i  did  .  i  most  certainly  did  .  and  he  said  ,  he  goes  ,  "  oh  ,  yeah  .  you're  jeanette's  friend  .  we  did  meet  once  .  "  and  i  said  ,  "  well  ,  how  do  you  go  from  that  to  totally  ignoring  a  person  when  they  walk  by  ?  "
(TheExGirlfriend) and  he  says  ,  he  says  ,  "  look  ,  i  just  didn't  want  to  say  hello  anymore  ,  alright  ?  "  and  i  said  ,  "  fine  .  fine  i  didn't  want  to  say  hello  anymore  either  ,  but  i  wanted  you  to  know  that  i'm  aware  of  it  .  "
(TheExGirlfriend) this  cantaloupe  stinks  .  STAGEDIR
(TheJacket) the  back  ?  they  never  find  anything  in  the  back  .  if  they  had  anything  good  in  the  back  ,  they'd  put  it  out  in  the  front  .

(TheJacket) well  ,  he  said  he'd  drive  me  here  right  after  .  so  ,  i  am  sitting  in  his  car  twenty  minutes  !  he  doesn't  come  down  .  i  am  freezing  .  then  a  cop  comes  by  ,  tells  me  to  get  out  of  the  car  .  he's  a  city  marshal  .  he's  towing  the  car  away  .  kramer  owes  thousands  of  dollars  in  back  tickets  .  he  was  going  to  tow  it  with  me  in  the  car  !  so  ,  they  tow  the  car  .  now  ,  i  am  standing  outside  ,  and  i  am  freezing  ,  but  i  cannot  leave  because  i  have  to  tell  him  what  happened  to  the  car  .  .  so  ,  finally  ,  he  finally  comes  down  with  his  giant  cage  filled  with  doves  .  he  said  he  was  getting  special  instructions  ,  that  each  dove  has  a  different  diet  .  so  ,  we're  wandering  around  trying  to  get  a  cab  ,  when  two  of  these  doves  fly  out  !  now  we're  running  down  the  street  after  these  doves  .  i  almost  got  hit  by  a  bus  .  STAGEDIR  .  .  so  how's  everything  going  over  here  ?
(TheJacket) good  .  'cause  dad  can  make  some  people  a  little  uncomfortable  .
(TheJacket) man  ,  kramer  !  i  could  kill  him  .

(TheJacket) STAGEDIR  yeah  ,  he  like  you  though  .  said  you  reminded  him  of  somebody  he  knew  in  korea  .
(TheJacket) dad  thinks  george  is  gay  .

(ThePonyRemark) so  you  cna't  do  both  ?
(ThePonyRemark) how  can  you  even  consider  not  going  ?
(ThePonyRemark) you  know  ,  funerals  always  make  me  think  about  my  own  mortality  and  how  i'm  actually  going  to  die  someday  .  me  ,  dead  .  imagine  that  .
