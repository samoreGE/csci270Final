(MaleUnbonding) most  men  like  working  on  things  ,  tools  ,  objects  ,  fixing  things  .  this  is  what  men  enjoy  doing  .  have  you  ever  noticed  a  guy's  out  in  his  driveway  working  on  something  with  tools  ,  how  all  the  other  men  in  the  neighborhood  are  magnetically  drawn  to  this  activity  .  they  just  come  wandering  out  of  the  house  like  zombies  .  men  ,  it's  true  ,  men  hear  a  drill  ,  it's  like  a  dog  whistle  .  just  .  .  you  know  ,  they  go  running  up  to  that  living  room  curtain  ,  "  honey  ,  i  think  jim's  working  on  something  over  there  .  "  so  they  run  over  to  the  guy  .  now  they  don't  actually  help  the  guy  .  no  ,  they  just  want  to  hang  around  the  area  where  work  is  being  done  .  that's  what  men  want  to  do  .  we  want  to  watch  the  guy  ,  we  want  to  talk  to  him  ,  we  want  to  ask  him  dumb  questions  .  you  know  ,  "  what  are  you  using  ,  the  philips  head  ?  "  you  know  ,  we  feel  involved  .  that's  why  when  they  have  construction  sites  ,  they  have  to  have  those  wood  panel  fences  around  it  ,  that's  just  to  keep  the  men  out  .  they  cut  those  little  holes  for  us  so  we  can  see  what  the  hell  is  going  on  .  but  if  they  don't  cut  those  holes  -  we  are  climbing  those  fences  .  right  over  there  .  "  what  are  you  using  the  steel  girders  down  there  ?  yeah  ,  that'll  hold  .  "
(MaleUnbonding) i  don't  think  you  did  anything  wrong  .
(MaleUnbonding) we  can  only  thank  god  for  that  .
(MaleUnbonding) you're  imagining  this  .  really  .
(MaleUnbonding) what  floss  ?  when  ?
(MaleUnbonding) ah  ,  mint  .
(MaleUnbonding) so  let  me  get  this  straight
(MaleUnbonding) and  you're  sure  the  floss  was  the  catalyst  ?
(MaleUnbonding) STAGEDIR  you  don't  think  it  might've  had  anything  to  do  with  that  ?
(MaleUnbonding) it  looks  like  your  belt  is  digesting  a  small  animal  .
(MaleUnbonding) STAGEDIR  who  is  it  ?
(MaleUnbonding) who  is  it  ?
(MaleUnbonding) STAGEDIR  hello  ?  oh  ,  hi  joel  .  STAGEDIR  .  .  no  .  i  was  out  of  town  .  i  just  got  back  .  .  kramer  doesn't  know  anything  .  .  he's  just  my  next-door  neighbor  .  uh  .  .  nothing  much  .  .  tuesday  ?  uh  ,  tuesday  ,  no  .  i'm  meeting  somebody  .  .  uh  ,  wednesday  ?  wednesday's  okay  .  .  alright  .  uh  ,  i'm  a  little  busy  right  now  .  can  we  talk  wednesday  morning  ?  .  .  okay  .  .  yeah  .  .  right  .  .  thanks  .  .  bye  .  STAGEDIR  why  did  you  put  me  on  the  phone  with  him  ?  i  hate  just  being  handed  a  phone  .
(MaleUnbonding) maybe  i  didn't  want  to  talk  to  him  .
(MaleUnbonding) he  bothers  me  .  i  don't  even  answer  the  phone  anymore  because  of  him  .  he's  turned  me  into  a  screener  .  now  i  gotta  go  see  him  on  wednesday  .
(MaleUnbonding) we're  going  .  that's  next  wednesday  .
(MaleUnbonding) his  name  is  joel  horneck  .  he  lived  like  three  houses  down  from  me  when  i  grew  up  .  he  had  a  ping  pong  table  .  we  were  friends  .  should  i  suffer  the  rest  of  my  life  because  i  like  to  play  ping  pong  ?  i  was  ten  .  i  would've  been  friends  with  stalin  if  he  had  a  ping  pong  table  .  .  he's  so  self-involved  .  STAGEDIR
(MaleUnbonding) can  you  conduct  your  business  elsewhere  ?
(MaleUnbonding) i  don't  bother  with  him  .  he's  been  calling  me  for  seven  years  .  i've  never  called  him  once  !  he's  got  the  attention  span  of  a  five-year-old  .  sometimes  i  sit  there  and  i  make  up  things  just  to  see  if  he's  paying  attention  .
(MaleUnbonding) what  can  i  do  ?  break  up  with  him  ?  tell  him  "  i  don't  think  we're  right  for  each  other  .  .  "  he's  a  guy  .  at  least  with  a  woman  ,  there's  a  precedent  .  you  know  ,  the  relationship  goes  sour  ,  you  end  it  .
(MaleUnbonding) just  break  up  with  him  ?
(MaleUnbonding) as  a  guy  i  don't  know  how  i  can  break  up  with  another  guy  .  you  know  what  i  mean  ?  i  don't  know  how  to  say  ,  "  bill  ,  i  feel  i  need  to  see  other  men  .  "  do  you  know  what  i  mean  ?  there's  nothing  i  can  do  .  i  have  to  wait  for  someone  to  die  .  i  think  that's  the  only  way  out  of  this  relationship  .  it  could  be  a  long  time  .  see  ,  the  great  thing  about  guys  is  that  we  can  become  friends  based  on  almost  nothing  .  just  two  guys  will  just  become  friends  just  because  they're  two  guys  .  that's  almost  all  we  need  to  have  in  common  .  'cause  sports  -  sports  and  women  -  is  really  all  we  talk  about  .  if  there  was  no  sports  and  no  women  the  only  thing  guys  would  ever  say  is  "  so  ,  what's  in  the  refrigerator  ?  "
(MaleUnbonding) you  know  ,  i  read  the  lenny  bruce  biography  ,  i  thought  it  was  really  -  interesting  .  .  he  would-

(MaleUnbonding) i  do  not  like  the  bank  .  i've  heard  the  expression  "  laughing  all  the  way  to  the  bank  .  "  i  have  never  seen  anyone  actually  doing  it  .  and  those  bank  lines  .  i  hate  it  when  there's  nobody  on  the  line  at  all  ,  you  know  that  part  ,  you  go  to  the  bank  ,  it's  empty  and  you  still  have  to  go  through  the  little  maze  .  "  can  you  get  a  little  piece  of  cheese  for  me  ?  i'm  almost  at  the  front  .  i'd  like  a  reward  for  this  please  .  "

(MaleUnbonding) i  have  to  say  something  .  with  all  due  respect  ,  i  just  never  .  .  i  can't  imagine  anyone  in  any  walk  of  life  ,  under  any  circumstance  ,  wanting  to  make  their  own  pizza  pie  .  .  but  that's  me  .

(MaleUnbonding) what  can  i  do  ?
(MaleUnbonding) oh  no  .  that's  impossible  .  i'd  rather  lie  to  him  for  the  rest  of  my  life  that  go  through  that  again  .  he  was  crying  ,  tears  accompanied  by  mucus  .
(MaleUnbonding) a  couple  of  touch  monkeys  .
(MaleUnbonding) game  ?
(MaleUnbonding) wait  .  how  does  horneck  know  you  ?

(MaleUnbonding) we're  still  friends  .
(MaleUnbonding) right  .  i  forgot  about  choir  .
(MaleUnbonding) right  .  you  know  ,  the  wall  being  down  and  everything  .
(MaleUnbonding) you  really  should  .
(MaleUnbonding) you  know  ,  i  really  .  .  i've  come  to  the  conclusion  that  there  are  certain  friends  in  you  life  that  they're  just  always  your  friends  and  you  have  to  accept  it  .  you  see  them  ,  you  don't  really  want  to  see  them  .  you  don't  call  them  .  they  call  you  .  you  don't  call  back  .  they  call  again  .  the  only  way  to  get  through  talking  with  people  that  you  don't  really  have  anything  in  common  with  is  to  pretend  you're  hosting  your  own  little  talk  show  .  this  is  what  i  do  .  you  pretend  there's  a  little  desk  around  you  .  the  only  problem  with  this  is  there's  no  way  you  can  say  ,  "  hey  ,  it's  been  great  having  you  on  the  show  .  were  out  of  time  .  "
(TheDoorman) you  remember  a  few  years  ago  in  new  york  ,  we  had  the  doorman  strike  ?  they  have  a  union  ,  in  the  fancy  buildings  ,  and  they  went  out  on  strike  .  now  you  would  think  ,  if  any  group  of  people  would  not  wanna  demonstrate  what  life  would  be  like  without  them  ,  it  would  be  doormen  .  STAGEDIR  "  let's  see  how  they  do  without  us  !  "  there's  no  doorman  ,  people  open  the  door  ,  they  walk  in  ,  it's  .  .  .  you  know  .  who's  gonna  walk  out  next  ?  the  guys  who  clean  your  windshield  at  the  traffic  light  ,  with  the  dirty  rag  ?  STAGEDIR  "  we  demand  shorter  yellows  ,  and  longer  reds  !  "

(TheDoorman) we'll  still  make  the  movie  .
(TheDoorman) uh  ,  that  doorman's  still  milling  around  outside  .  he's  very  peculiar  .
(TheDoorman) STAGEDIR  hello  ?  STAGEDIR  oh  ,  hi  mr  .  pitt  .

(TheDoorman) boy  ,  that  brain  never  stops  working  ,  does  it  ?
(TheDoorman) what  ?  nothing  .
(TheDoorman) what  has  this  guy  got  a  personal  vendetta  with  me  ?  !  what'd  i  do  to  him  ?  'cos  i  asked  him  about  the  knicks  ?

(TheDoorman) yes  ,  we  do  .
(TheDoorman) he's  .  .  .  trying  to  get  something  off  his  chest  .
(TheDoorman) STAGEDIR  hoh  !  what're  you  doing  here  ?  you're  supposed  to  be  gone  .
(TheDoorman) STAGEDIR  look  ,  i  don't  want  any  trouble  .  i  don't  have  a  doorman  in  my  building  .  i  guess  i'm  just  not  used  to  talking  to  them  .  i'd  really  just  like  to  be  friends  .

(TheDoorman) yeah  .
(TheDoorman) he  asked  me  to  .  we  were  getting  along  .
(TheDoorman) don't  you  find  it  odd  that  as  soon  as  he  leaves  ,  the  couch  gets  stolen  ?  maybe  he's  setting  me  up  !
(TheDoorman) alright  ,  well  what  if  we  say  .  .  .

(TheDoorman) STAGEDIR  diabolical  .  he  thought  of  everything  .  he  was  setting  me  up  from  day  one  !
(TheDoorman) i'm  sure  he's  having  a  good  laugh  over  this  with  his  doorman  buddies  .
(TheDoorman) now  we  have  to  buy  a  new  couch  ?  !

(TheExGirlfriend) i'm  always  in  traffic  with  the  lane  expert  .  you  know  this  type  of  person  ?  constantly  reevaluating  their  lane  choice  .  .  never  quite  sure  ,  "  is  this  the  best  lane  for  me  ?  for  my  life  ?  "  they're  always  a  little  bit  ahead  of  you  ,  "  can  i  get  in  over  there  ?  could  i  get  in  over  here  ?  could  i  get  in  there  ?  "  "  yeah  ,  come  on  over  here  ,  pal  .  we're  zoomin'  over  here  .  this  is  the  secret  lane  ,  nobody  knows  about  it  .  .  "  the  ultimate  ,  i  think  the  ultimate  psychological  test  of  traffic  is  the  total  dead  stop  .  not  even  rolling  .  and  you  look  out  the  window  ,  you  can  see  gum  clearly  .  so  we  know  that  in  the  future  traffic  will  get  even  worse  than  that  .  i  mean  ,  what  will  happen  ?  will  it  start  moving  backwords  ,  i  wonder  ?  i  mean  ,  is  that  possible  ?  that  someday  we'll  be  going  "  boy  ,  this  is  some  really  bad  traffic  now  ,  boy  .  this  ,  is  really  bad  .  i'm  gonna  try  to  get  off  and  get  back  on  going  the  other  way  .

(TheExGirlfriend) no  ,  no  .  it's  not  your  fault  .  books  ,  books  ,  i  need  my  books  .  have  you  re-read  those  books  yet  ,  by  the  way  ?  you  know  the  great  thing  ?  when  you  read  moby  dick  the  second  time  ,  ahab  and  the  whale  become  good  friends  .  you  know  ,  it's  not  like  marlene's  a  bad  person  or  anything  ,  but  ,  my  god  !  i  mean  ,  we've  had  like  three  lunches  and  a  movie  .  and  she  never  stops  calling  .  STAGEDIR  and  it's  these  meaningless  ,  purposeless  ,  blather  calls  .  she  never  asks  if  i'm  busy  or  anything  .  i  just  pick  up  the  phone  and  she's  in  the  middle  of  a  sentence  .
(TheExGirlfriend) ohh  .  .  you  know  ,  and  sometimes  she'll  go  ,  "  hello  ,  jerry  ?  "  and  i'll  go  "  oh  ,  hi  marlene  .  "  and  then  it's  "  jerry  .  .  "
(TheExGirlfriend) ohhhh  .  .  you  can't  .  it's  impossible  .  there's  no  break  in  the  conversation  where  you  can  go  ,  "  alright  ,  then  .  .  "  you  know  ,  it  just  goes  on  and  on  and  on  with  out  a  break  in  the  wall  .  i  mean  ,  i  gotta  put  a  stop  to  this  .
(TheExGirlfriend) yeah  .  yes  ,  she  is  .
(TheExGirlfriend) waiting  room  .  i  hate  when  they  make  you  wait  in  the  room  .  'cause  it  says  "  waiting  room  .  "  there's  no  chance  of  not  waiting  ,  'cause  they  call  it  the  waiting  room  ,  they're  going  to  use  it  .  they've  got  it  .  it's  all  set  up  for  you  to  wait  .  and  you  sit  there  ,  you  know  ,  and  you've  got  your  little  magazine  .  you  pretend  you're  reading  it  ,  but  you're  really  looking  at  the  other  people  .  you  know  ,  you're  thinking  about  about  them  things  like  "  i  wonder  what  he's  got  .  as  soon  as  she  goes  ,  i'm  getting  her  magazine  .  "  and  then  ,  they  finally  call  you  and  it's  a  very  exciting  moment  .  they  finally  call  you  ,  and  you  stand  up  and  you  kinda  look  around  at  the  other  people  in  the  room  .  "  well  ,  i  guess  i've  been  chosen  .  i'll  see  you  all  later  .  "  you  know  ,  so  you  think  you're  going  to  see  the  doctor  ,  but  you're  not  ,  are  you  ?  no  .  you're  going  into  the  next  waiting  room  .  the  littler  waiting  room  .  but  if  they  are  ,  you  know  ,  doing  some  sort  of  medical  thing  to  you  ,  you  want  to  be  in  the  smallest  room  that  they  have  ,  i  think  .  you  don't  wnat  to  be  in  the  largest  room  that  they  have  .  you  know  what  i  mean  ?  you  ever  see  these  operating  theaters  ,  that  they  have  ,  with  like  ,  stadium  seating  ?  you  don't  want  them  doing  antying  to  you  that  makes  other  doctors  go  ,  "  i  have  to  see  this  !  "  "  are  you  kidding  ?  are  they  really  gonna  do  that  to  him  ?  "  "  are  there  seats  ?  can  we  get  in  ?  "  do  they  scalp  tickets  to  these  things  ?  "  i  got  two  for  the  winslow  tumor  ,  i  got  two  .  .  "

(TheExGirlfriend) tuesday  night  ?  what  happened  tuesday  night  ?
(TheExGirlfriend) my  act  ?  what  does  that  have  to  do  with  anything  ?
(TheExGirlfriend) i  can't  believe  this  .  so  what  are  you  saying  ?  you  didn't  like  my  act  ,  so  that's  it  ?
(TheExGirlfriend) you're  a  cashier  !
(TheExGirlfriend) you  can't  go  by  the  audience  that  night  .  it  was  late  .  they  were  terrible  .
(TheExGirlfriend) i  have  other  stuff  .  you  should  come  see  me  on  the  weekend  .
(TheExGirlfriend) women  need  to  like  the  job  of  the  guy  they're  with  .  if  they  don't  like  the  job  ,  they  don't  like  the  guy  .  men  know  this  .  which  is  why  we  make  up  the  phony  bogus  names  for  the  jobs  that  we  have  .  "  well  ,  right  now  ,  i'm  the  regional  management  supervisor  .  "  "  i'm  in  development  ,  research  ,  consulting  .  "  men  on  the  other  hand  ,  if  they  are  physically  attracted  to  a  woman  are  not  that  concerned  with  her  job  .  are  we  ?  men  don't  really  care  .  men'll  just  go  ,  "  really  ?  slaughterhouse  ?  is  that  were  you  work  ?  that  sounds  interesting  .  so  whatdya  got  a  big  cleaver  there  ?  you're  just  lopping  their  heads  off  ?  that  sounds  great  !  listen  ,  why  don't  you  shower  up  ,  and  we'll  get  some  burgers  and  catch  a  movie  .  "
(TheJacket) i  hate  clothes  ,  okay  ?  i  hate  buying  them  .  i  hate  picking  them  out  of  my  closet  .  i  can't  stand  every  day  trying  to  come  up  with  little  outfits  for  myself  .  i  think  eventually  fashion  won't  even  exist  .  it  won't  .  i  think  eventually  we'll  all  be  wearing  the  same  thing  .  'cause  anytime  i  see  a  movie  or  a  tv  show  where  there's  people  from  the  future  of  another  planet  ,  they're  all  wearing  the  same  thing  .  somehow  they  decided  "  this  is  going  to  be  our  outfit  .  one-piece  silver  jumpsuit  ,  v-stripe  ,  and  boots  .  that's  it  .  "  we  should  come  up  for  an  outfit  for  earth  .  an  earth  outfit  .  we  should  vote  on  it  .  candidates  propose  different  outfits  ,  no  speeches  .  they  walk  out  ,  twirl  ,  walk  off  .  we  just  sit  in  the  audience  and  go  ,  "  that  was  nice  .  i  could  wear  that  .  "
(TheJacket) i  think  i've  seen  enough  .
(TheJacket) why  don't  they  open  up  an  entire  store  for  the  back  ?  call  it  ,  "  just  back  .  "  all  back  .  no  front  .  you  walk  in  the  front  ,  you're  immediately  in  the  back  .  STAGEDIR  look  ,  elaine  ,  tie  car  wash  .

(ThePonyRemark) .  .  well  ,  i  didn't  really  mean  a  pony  ,  per  se  .
(ThePonyRemark) nothing  .  nothing  at  all  .  i  was  just  merely  expressting  .  .

(ThePonyRemark) i  didn't  know  she  had  a  pony  .  how  was  i  to  know  she  had  a  pony  ?  who  figures  an  immigrant's  going  to  have  a  pony  ?  do  you  know  what  the  odds  are  on  that  ?  i  mean  ,  in  all  the  pictures  i  saw  of  immigrants  on  boats  coming  into  new  york  harbor  ,  i  never  saw  one  of  them  sitting  on  a  pony  .  why  would  anybody  come  here  if  they  had  a  pony  ?  who  leaves  a  country  packed  with  ponies  to  come  to  a  non-pony  country  ?  it  doesn't  make  sense  .  .  am  i  wrong  ?
(ThePonyRemark) i'll  drive  you  to  the  airport  .

(ThePonyRemark) i  don't  know  what  to  do  .
(ThePonyRemark) we  don't  understand  death  .  and  the  proof  of  this  is  that  we  give  dead  people  a  pillow  .  and  ,  uh  ,  i  mean  ,  hey  ,  you  know  .  i  think  if  you  can't  stretch  out  and  get  some  solid  rest  at  that  point  ,  i  don't  see  how  bedding  accessories  really  make  the  difference  .  i  mean  ,  they  got  the  guy  in  a  suit  with  a  pillow  .  no  is  he  going  to  a  meeting  ,  or  is  he  catching  forty  winks  ?  i  mean  ,  let's  make  up  our  mind  where  we  think  they're  going  .
(ThePonyRemark) two  forty-five  .
(ThePonyRemark) two  o'  clock  .
(ThePonyRemark) depends  on  how  nice  the  person  was  .  but  you  gotta  figure  ,  even  oswald  took  forty-five  minutes  .
(ThePonyRemark) you  know  ,  if  the  situation  were  reversed  and  manya  had  some  mah-jongg  championship  or  something  ,  i  wouldn't  expect  her  to  go  to  my  funeral  .  i  would  understand  .
(ThePonyRemark) i  know  ,  and  then  you  say  to  yourself  ,  "  from  this  moment  on  ,  i'm  not  going  to  waste  any  more  of  it  .  "  but  then  you  go  ,  "  how  ?  what  can  i  do  that's  not  wasting  it  ?  "
(ThePonyRemark) me  ?  what  about  you  ?  you  brought  up  the  pony  .

(ThePonyRemark) i'll  have  to  live  with  this  shame  for  the  rest  of  my  life  .
(ThePonyRemark) i  thought  there  were  two  outs  .
(ThePonyRemark) it  was  the  single  worst  moment  of  my  life  .
(ThePonyRemark) oh  ,  well  ,  of  course  .  1973  .
(ThePonyRemark) wonder  about  what  ?
(ThePonyRemark) you  think  manya  showed  up  during  the  game  and  put  a  hex  on  me  ?
(ThePonyRemark) but  i  went  ot  the  funeral  .
(ThePonyRemark) don't  you  think  she  would've  heard  i  was  there  ?
(ThePonyRemark) who  figures  an  immigrant's  gonna  have  a  pony  ?
(ThePonyRemark) what  is  the  pony  ?  what  is  the  point  of  the  pony  ?  why  do  we  have  these  animals  ,  these  ponies  ?  what  do  we  do  with  them  ?  besides  the  pony  ride  .  why  ponies  ?  what  are  we  doing  with  them  ?  i  mean  ,  police  don't  use  them  for  ,  you  know  ,  crowd  control  .  "  hey  ,  uh  ,  you  wanna  get  back  behind  the  barricades  .  hey  !  hey  ,  little  boy  .  yeah  ,  i'm  talking  to  you  .  behind  the  barricades  !  "  so  somebody  ,  i  assume  ,  genetically  engineered  these  ponies  .  do  you  think  they  could  make  them  any  size  ?  i  mean  ,  could  they  make  them  like  the  size  of  a  quarter  ,  if  they  wanted  ?  that  would  be  fun  for  monopoly  ,  though  ,  wouldn't  it  ?  just  have  a  little  pony  and  you  put  him  on  the  ,  "  baltic  ,  that's  two  down  ,  go  ahead  .  hold  it  .  right  ther  ,  baltic  .  yeah  ,  that's  it  .  fine  .  right  there  ,  hold  it  right  there  .  "
(TheStockTip) went  out  to  dinner  the  other  night  .  check  came  at  the  end  of  the  meal  ,  as  it  always  does  .  never  liked  the  check  at  the  end  of  the  meal  system  ,  because  money's  a  very  different  thing  before  and  after  you  eat  .  before  you  eat  money  has  no  value  .  and  you  don't  care  about  money  when  you're  hungry  ,  you  sit  down  at  a  restaurant  .  you're  like  the  ruler  of  an  empire  .  "  more  drinks  ,  appetizers  ,  quickly  ,  quickly  !  it  will  be  the  greatest  meal  of  our  lives  .  "  then  after  the  meal  ,  you  know  ,  you've  got  the  pants  open  ,  you've  got  the  napkins  destroyed  ,  cigarette  butt  in  the  mashed  potatoes  -  then  the  check  comes  at  that  moment  .  people  are  always  upset  ,  you  know  .  they're  mystified  by  the  check  .  "  what  is  this  ?  how  could  this  be  ?  "  they  start  passing  it  around  the  table  ,  "  does  this  look  right  to  you  ?  we're  not  hungry  now  .  why  are  we  buying  all  this  food  ?  !  "
(TheStockTip) but  it's  common  sense  .  he's  got  super  strength  ,  super  speed  .  .  i'm  sure  he's  got  super  humor  .
(TheStockTip) why  ?  why  would  that  one  area  of  his  mind  not  be  affected  by  the  yellow  sun  of  earth  ?

STAGEDIR  wilkinson  ,  the  guy  who's  supposed  to  tell  us  when  to  sell  the  stock  ,  he's  in  the  hospital  .

(TheStockTip) well  ,  this  is  it  .  i'm  selling  .
(TheStockTip) i  never  should've  gotten  involved  in  this  .  i'm  a  nervous  wreck  .  i  "  m  not  cut  out  for  investing  .
(TheStockTip) where  ?
(TheStockTip) the  hospital  ?
(TheStockTip) are  you  nuts  ?  you  don't  even  know  they  guy  .
(TheStockTip) what  if  he's  in  an  iron  lung  or  something  ?  what  are  you  gonna  do  ?  STAGEDIR  "  how  you  feeling  ,  mr  .  wilkinson  ?  STAGEDIR  by  the  way  ,  what's  happening  with  sendrax  ?  "
(TheStockTip) who  goes  to  the  hospital  to  rest  ?
(TheStockTip) okay  ,  fine  ,  fine  .  when  are  you  going  down  there  ?
(TheStockTip) alright  .
(TheStockTip) yeah  .  i  picked  up  this  shirt  here  yesterday  .  it's  completely  shrunk  .  there's  absolutely  no  way  i  can  wear  it  .
(TheStockTip) what's  the  difference  ?  look  at  it  !  do  you  see  the  size  of  this  shirt  ?  !
(TheStockTip) i  can't  find  the  receipt  .
(TheStockTip) look  ,  forget  about  the  receipt  ,  all  right  ?  even  if  i  had  the  receipt-  look  at  it  !  it's  a  hand  puppet  .  what  am  i  gonna  do  with  this  ?  !
(TheStockTip) what  do  you  think  this  is  a  little  scam  i  have  ?  i  take  this  tiny  shirt  all  over  the  city  conning  dry  cleaners  out  of  money  ?  !  in  fact  ,  forget  the  money  .  i  don't  even  want  the  money  .  i  just  once  ,  i  would  like  to  hear  a  dry  cleaner  admit  that  something  was  their  fault  .  that's  what  i  want  .  i  want  an  admission  of  guilt  .
(TheStockTip) no  .  .  dry-cleaned  .
(TheStockTip) STAGEDIR  you  shrunk  it  !  you  know  you  shrunk  it  !  just  tell  me  that  you  shrunk  it  !
(TheStockTip) i  think  the  only  reason  we  go  to  the  dry  cleaner  is  so  i  can  say  to  the  dry  cleaner  ,  "  well  ,  it's  ruined  .  "  and  of  course  ,  the  dry  cleaner  can  respond  ,  "  it's  not  our  fault  .  we're  not  responsible  .  we  just  ruin  the  clothes  .  that  ends  our  legal  obligation  .  "  you  see  ,  the  whole  problem  with  dry  cleaning  is  that  we  all  believe  that  this  is  actually  possible  .  right  ?  they're  cleaning  our  clothes  -  but  they're  not  getting  anything  wet  .  it's  all  dry  .  i  know  there's  gotta  be  some  liquids  back  there  ,  some  fluids  that  they're  using  .  there's  no  such  thing  as  dry  cleaning  .  when  you  get  something  on  your  shirt  ,  ever  get  something  on  your  shirt  and  try  to  get  it  off  like  that  STAGEDIR  -  that's  dry  cleaning  .  i  don't  think  that's  what  they're  doing  back  there  .  they  don't  have  eighty  guys  going  STAGEDIR  "  come  on  ,  hurry  up  !  there's  a  lot  of  shirts  today  .  "
(TheStockTip) bless  you  .
